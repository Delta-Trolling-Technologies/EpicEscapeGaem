**[DOWNLOAD NOW!!1!](https://github.com/BalazsManus/EpicEscapeGaem/releases/latest/launcher.exe/download)**

*Protip: No install required for the launcher and the game is installed locally (appdata/roaming/EEG)*

Really hard game with challenges and unusual crap and dad jokes, with a little sprinkle of memes.
